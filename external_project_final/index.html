                    About Us
                </h2>
                    <p>
                        We are a team of media producers and social media marketers dedicated to unifying the vast artistic and professional talent in Houston, TX, and providing a platform 
                        for these high achievers to share their voices and their talents.
                    </p> 
                    <p>
                        We conduct video interviews and post our content on YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. We have already featured many artists and bands on our video show "The Street Couch",
                        such as Midnight Beverage, The Kiddos, Midnight Spies, Zee Fine Art. We have also had the pleasure to interview talented people of other fields besides art, such as 
                        Fermin Garcia and Lizbeth Alcantar, who are both medical professionals. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Street Couch Entertainment has been constanly evolving for many years now.
                        We started off as a blog with a short-lived video series, then an audio podcast, and from there we placed most of our focus on video interviews.
                        We noticed we got the most engagement when we intervewed well-known bands in the local music scene in Houston,
                        as well as our iconic interviews with the Houston skyline in the background.
                        We are constanly analyzing what works and what doesn't, and making constant improvement 
                        in order to give our audience content of high quality. 
                    </p>
                    <p> Our mission is to help Houston's talent be heard, and help them reach people in ways they can't do with their work alone.</p>
